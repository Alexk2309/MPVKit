# MPVKit CocoaPods Demo

This is a demo project for MPVKit using CocoaPods.

## Setup

1. This demo uses the exact same source code as Demo-iOS but with a CocoaPods-based integration.
2. The `Podfile` includes the MPVKit pod by reference to the local podspec file.

## Building

1. Make sure you have CocoaPods installed: `gem install cocoapods`
2. Run `pod install` in this directory to install the dependencies
3. Open `Demo-iOS.xcworkspace` (not the .xcodeproj file)
4. Build and run the project

## Implementation Details

This project uses the exact same source code as the Demo-iOS project, but integrates the MPVKit framework using CocoaPods instead of Swift Package Manager. This demonstrates the flexibility of the MPVKit framework and provides an alternative integration method.
